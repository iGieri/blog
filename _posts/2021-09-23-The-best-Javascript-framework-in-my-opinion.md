## Which is the best JS framework? 🤔

I think that there isn't a real answer to this question... 😢

It is too much subjective, You have to choose which is your favourite JS framework. 😄

I will write for you a short introduction about the most popular JS frameworks so you can choose between them.

Enjoy it 🤖

### React ⚛

React, made by Facebook in 2013, is the most popular JavaScript framework in the world! 🌍

You can find any kind of package and a big community support on Stack Overflow! 🤝

Coding in React is very simple and easy to learn. 🧠

React is based on components which represent a dynamic part of your website that you can reuse as many times you want. 😉

Here you can see an example of how to code a component: 👀

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function Button(props) {
    return(
        <div onClick={props.onClick}>
            {props.children}
        </div>
    )
}
```

Now you have created a button component that you can reuse anywhere in your page with the tag. 🤩

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function App() {
    return (
        <Button onClick={alert('Hello!')}>Test</Button>
    )
}
```

The JSX language created by React Developers allows you to use HTML syntax in JS that is 🤯

### Angular 🅰

Angular, made by Google in 2016, is the second most popular JavaScript framework in the world! 🌍

Angular is the most requested framework by companies because it is mainly used for big projects. 💼

It uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript and It has the best cli that you can find in a web framework! 💻

An Angular component is usually composed by three files: `button.component.ts`, `button.component.html` and `button.component.css`.

They are all generated by the cli.

While React include HTML syntax in JS, Angular transform HTML in a programming language including `if`,`for`, etc., etc. 🔀

### Vue.js 🔽

Vue.js, made by Evan You in 2014, is the third most popular JavaScript framework in the world! 🌍

Vue.js is not too much requested by companies and it is not too much supported, but it is really cool anyways! 😎

It seems like an evolution of Angular. In fact it provides a really good cli and an ui to manage all the plugins and the whole project. 😲

Seems good yeah? 😏

It also include the three component files of Angular in one beautiful file `.vue`

Here an example of this file: 👀

```html
<template>
    <p>{{ greeting }} World!</p>
</template>

<script>
module.exports = {
    data: function() {
        return {
            greeting: 'Hello'
        }
    }
}
</script>

<style scoped>
p {
    font-size: 2em;
    text-align: center;
}
</style>
```

This file organization is perfect for personal projects, but could be limitated for big teams projects.

This is another reason because companies don't use so much vue.js.

### Personal opinion

I'm a React Developer and I love it 😍

But I'm also studying Vue.js because It is a really cool project and you can do great things with it! 😉


Thank you for your time.

I hope you enojoyed it 😄
